## Website clones made in less than 24 work-hours, can only be changed later to fix minor bugs
The objective is not for the site to be exactly the same as the cloned one, but to demonstrate knowledge of the techniques (not necessarily the same used by the website creator, it is possible to have reached a similar result by other methods). The only items reuseds are the images and fonts! All the html, css and js code is made from scratch and not even a single line is copied (the whole clone is done in less than 24 hours). ðŸ¤“ðŸ”¥
